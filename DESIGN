4 pages of the filesystem will be taken up by
1st page:
 - super block information (size, root dir location, etc)
 - inode / data-block bitmap (256-bits each = 64 bytes)
   - honestly, could probably do without the bitmap, makes it very
     to do lookups, let do that for now
2nd - 4th pages:
 - inodes (allocated as needed)
5th+ page:
 - data blocks
